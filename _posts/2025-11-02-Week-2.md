## 1. Data Sources & Collection Strategy
[cite_start]We constructed a diverse dataset to detect classroom environments by combining public datasets with self-captured proprietary data[cite: 1, 2, 8].

* [cite_start]**Public Data:** Augmented with Kaggle datasets (Human Activity Recognition, Classroom Image Data) to improve generalizability[cite: 3, 5, 7, 9].
* [cite_start]**Proprietary Data:** Self-captured images in our actual lecture rooms to reflect specific environmental conditions[cite: 11, 19].
* **Diversity Strategy:**
    * [cite_start]**Environmental:** Various activities (sitting, meeting, clapping)[cite: 13].
    * [cite_start]**Temporal:** Captured at different times (10 AM, 3 PM, 8 PM) to simulate day/night lighting[cite: 15].
    * [cite_start]**Spatial:** Captured from diverse camera angles[cite: 16].

## 2. Labeling Guidelines (Ground Truth)
[cite_start]We defined clear rules to label the data for three key states: **Presence, Light, and Projector**[cite: 28].

### [cite_start]A. Presence (Occupied / Empty) [cite: 29]
* [cite_start]**Rule:** If a person is partly visible, it counts as **'Occupied'**[cite: 33].
* [cite_start]**Exception:** People visible only on a screen (e.g., projector screen) do not count[cite: 34].

### [cite_start]B. Light State (On / Off) [cite: 30]
* [cite_start]**Rule:** Refers only to the **main ceiling lights**[cite: 35].
* [cite_start]**Edge Case:** Desk lamps or strong sunlight do not count as 'On'[cite: 36].

### [cite_start]C. Projector State (On / Off) [cite: 31]
* [cite_start]**Rule:** Includes standby modes (blue/black screen) if the lamp is active[cite: 37].

<br>

## [cite_start]3. Risk Management: Biases & Limitations [cite: 18]
* [cite_start]**Location Bias (Overfitting):** The model may perform poorly in rooms with different furniture styles or colors[cite: 20].
* [cite_start]**Functionality Scope:** The current dataset is for **detection only (Presence)**, not for counting the number of people[cite: 23].

## [cite_start]4. Data Hygiene Policy [cite: 53]
To ensure model quality, we applied strict hygiene rules:
1.  [cite_start]**De-duplication:** Removed visually identical or near-identical images to prevent model bias[cite: 54, 55].
2.  [cite_start]**Corrupted File Check:** All unreadable or wrong-format files were deleted before training[cite: 56].
3.  [cite_start]**Class Balance:** Verified the final counts for each class after labeling to address data imbalance[cite: 57, 58].
