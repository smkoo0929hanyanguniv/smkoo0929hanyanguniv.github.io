## 1. Data Sources & Collection Strategy
We constructed a diverse dataset to detect classroom environments by combining public datasets with self-captured proprietary data.

* **Public Data:** Augmented with Kaggle datasets (Human Activity Recognition, Classroom Image Data) to improve generalizability.
* **Proprietary Data:** Self-captured images in our actual lecture rooms to reflect specific environmental conditions.
* **Diversity Strategy:**
    * **Environmental:** Various activities (sitting, meeting, clapping).
    * **Temporal:** Captured at different times (10 AM, 3 PM, 8 PM) to simulate day/night lighting.
    * **Spatial:** Captured from diverse camera angles.

## 2. Labeling Guidelines (Ground Truth)
We defined clear rules to label the data for three key states: **Presence, Light, and Projector**.

### A. Presence (Occupied / Empty)
* **Rule:** If a person is partly visible, it counts as **'Occupied'**.
* **Exception:** People visible only on a screen (e.g., projector screen) do not count.

### B. Light State (On / Off)
* **Rule:** Refers only to the **main ceiling lights**.
* **Edge Case:** Desk lamps or strong sunlight do not count as 'On'.

### C. Projector State (On / Off)
* **Rule:** Includes standby modes (blue/black screen) if the lamp is active.

## 3. Risk Management: Biases & Limitations
* **Location Bias (Overfitting):** The model may perform poorly in rooms with different furniture styles or colors.
* **Functionality Scope:** The current dataset is for **detection only (Presence)**, not for counting the number of people.

## 4. Data Hygiene Policy
To ensure model quality, we applied strict hygiene rules:
1.  **De-duplication:** Removed visually identical or near-identical images to prevent model bias.
2.  **Corrupted File Check:** All unreadable or wrong-format files were deleted before training.
3.  **Class Balance:** Verified the final counts for each class after labeling to address data imbalance.
