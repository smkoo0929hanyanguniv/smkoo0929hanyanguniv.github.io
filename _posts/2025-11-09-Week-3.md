## 🎯 Weekly Goals
* [x] **Tech Stack Definition:** Finalize the equipment and software tools.
* [x] **Data Pipeline Design:** Map the flow from webcam input to game control.
* [x] **UX Flow:** Define the user journey from site access to gameplay.

<br>

## 💡 We changed the topic because the previous topic doesn't go well with Raspberry Pibout and it is hard to realize.

## 🛠️ System Architecture
### 1. Core Tech Stack
We selected tools that allow for real-time performance directly in the web browser.
* **AI/ML:** **Google MediaPipe** (Face Mesh/Iris Tracking) & **TensorFlow.js** (In-browser execution).
* **Game Engine:** **p5.js** (HTML5 Canvas) for rendering the 2D game logic.
* **Hosting:** **Netlify / Vercel** for static web hosting.

### 2. Data Pipeline Logic
1.  **Input:** The `getUserMedia` API captures webcam frames.
2.  **Processing:** TF.js extracts eye landmarks (e.g., coordinates 43-48) in real-time.
3.  **Calculation:** The system calculates the Y-coordinate of the eye's center and normalizes it (0 to 1).
4.  **Action:** This normalized value is directly mapped to the paddle's vertical position.

## 🔄 User Experience (UX) Flow
1.  **Start:** User visits the web URL.
2.  **Permission:** Browser requests camera access. If denied, an error message appears.
3.  **Calibration:** The game UI appears, and the system calibrates to the user's eye level.
4.  **Play:** The Pong game begins. The paddle moves in sync with the user's gaze.
5.  **Feedback:** Final score is displayed upon Game Over.

<br>

## 💡 Feasibility & Practicability
* **Low Latency:** By processing data locally (Client-side) without a server, we ensure the game is responsive (<150ms).
* **Robustness:** Instead of pixel-perfect precision, we rely on "Gaze Zones" (Top/Middle/Bottom) and Dwell Time to overcome standard webcam limitations.
