## 🎯 Weekly Goals
* [x] **Model v1 Build:** Train a blink detection model using Teachable Machine.
* [x] **Performance Visualization:** Test the model with various image samples.
* [x] **Error Board:** Analyze failure cases and propose solutions.

<br>

## 🤖 Model Development (v1)
* **Purpose:** To detect "Blink" commands to Start or Pause the game.
* **Tool:** Google Teachable Machine (Image Project).
* **Classes:** The model infers three states: **Blink, Eyes Opened, Eyes Half-Opened**.
* **Implementation:** Using `TensorFlow.js` to run the trained model directly in the browser.

<br>

## 💥 Error Board (Analysis & Fixes)
We identified several edge cases where the model failed during testing.

### 1. Lighting & Reflection
* **Issue:** Strong light glare on glasses was captured as a feature, causing detection failure.
* **Fix:** Collect additional data with backlighting and strong indoor lighting conditions.

### 2. Motion Blur
* **Issue:** Rapid head movement caused blurry images, making eye features indistinguishable.
* **Fix:** Apply 'motion blur' effects during data augmentation and train with intentionally blurry images.

### 3. Occlusion
* **Issue:** Hair or thick eyeglass frames covering the eyes were misclassified as 'Half-Opened'.
* **Fix:** Intensively collect data of partially occluded eyes.

### 4. Distance & Squinting
* **Issue:** Accuracy dropped when the user was too far or squinting.
* **Fix:** Add training data for short distances and clearly visible eye shapes.

## 🚀 Next Actions
* **Real-time Transition:** Switch from file upload input to real-time webcam streaming.
* **Iris Tracking:** Integrate MediaPipe to track Y-coordinates for paddle movement.
* **Filtering:** Apply a **Moving Average Filter** to smooth out coordinate jitter.
